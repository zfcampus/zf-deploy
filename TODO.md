- ~~Check the .zpk package produced by zfdeploy using Zend Server 6.3~~
  - Potentially also provide functionality for actually _pushing_ the package to Zend Server via the server API?
  - ~~Added the -version option to specify the version for the .zpk package~~
  - ~~Added the icon support with auto-detection for ZF2 or Apigility applications~~
- ~~Deploy an Apigility application produced by the Admin UI (tested with this PR: https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-apigility-skeleton/pull/53)~~
- ~~Check if the development mode is disabled in production for Apigility~~
- Write the tests
- ~~Test the script in a Windows environment~~
- ~~Remove the /vendor/*/*/test folders in the deploy package for optimization~~
